# Social-Distancing
This is an android app which help the people to alert when they get very close so that they maintain social distance.

In this android app I use bluetooth rssi to get the strength of a phone's bluetooth signal and set the bluetooth rssi to a value so that people will maintain about 
2m distance between them.
When the people get near to another person this app will give both of them a vibrating message so that both people should maintain a perfect distance between them
and remain safe.

Technologies used: 
1. Android Studio
2. Bluetooth
3. Java
